Intro
=====

.. epigraph::

  Sam gasps for air, and finds herself alone.
  Herman gasps for air, and finds herself alone.
  They wipe the mud from their body.

  --`Riding SideSaddle*`_

The fragmented memories of Herman & Sam –
two people sharing one body –
as they navigate fluid genders and relationships.
Loosely based
on the life of Margaret Clap,
and the myth of Hermaphroditus.
