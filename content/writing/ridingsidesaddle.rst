About the Novel

is a fragmented and fictional memory,
written on 250 interchangeable index cards.
It follows Herman, Sam, and their friends,
as they navigate fluid genders, relationships,
and bodies.
The story is based loosely
on the real life of Margaret Clap,
and the various myths around Salmacis and Hermaphroditus.
