summary: |
  An adaptation of Riding SideSaddle*,
  by Buntport Theater, Teacup Gorilla, and myself.

    Following a group of friends that resist order, category and completion,
    this play weaves myth and storytelling with every day rituals.
    It is about people deeply in love, suffering loss,
    celebrating strangeness, all while they pluck their eyebrows.
    It is about the Greek myth of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus,
    who are merged into “one being of both sexes”
    and about what we see when we look in the mirror.
    Oh, and the whole thing is jammed in a little bathroom,
    complete with a three-piece band squeezed into the tub.
