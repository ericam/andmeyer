  “I’m standing here in a group of women, all strangers.
  They’re warm and kind, inclusive,
  as though I’m any other woman.
  Am I? I’ve seen myself in the mirror.
  I find me… disorienting. What do they see that I don’t?
  Why aren’t they laughing at me?”

Chapter Intro
=============

  I’m standing here in a group of women, all strangers.
  They’re warm and kind, inclusive,
  as though I’m any other woman.
  Am I? I’ve seen myself in the mirror.
  I find me… disorienting. What do they see that I don’t?

  Why aren’t they laughing at me?

About Twined Fragments
======================

`Twined Fragments`_ is an ongoing collaboration
between authors **Miriam Suzanne** and
`Allison Washington`_.
Each fragment is sparked by the previous,
as trans women of different generations
pass their memories back and forth,
reflecting on lives and transitions separated by a quarter-century.

.. _Allison Washington: http://allisonwashington.net/

Working through these fragments of reflection
lets us touch on moments and emotions
that are sometimes too painful to interrogate deeply.
In conversation, we do together what we could not alone.
The result leaves us with more questions than answers,
and we love that.

We want those questions,
and hope you will extend this conversation in the comments below.
