  I wasn't born in the wrong body.
  I was born in *my* body.
  Without it, I don't exist.


Gender Fragments
================

I wasn't born in the wrong body.
I was born in *my* body.
Without it, I don't exist.

*I was born, a body.*

Some bodies have freckles,
while some are six-foot-four and near-sighted.
Some grow thick hair,
while others have autism.
Each body comes with a unique mix of experiences —
affordances and constraints.
This body isn't wrong,
it's trans.

My genitals don't match my gender,
the way some bodies do.

You might need help with insulin.
I need help with estrogen.
I don't mean to medicalize this experience —
only to claim it,
and put it in my body.
I operate better on hormones I don't produce.
Most women call that menopause.
I call it transition.

---------

There's a temptation to cherry-pick the past,
to emphasize one particular story-arc,
associate myself with the proper stereotypes,
and prove I was *born this way* — 
a girl from my first breath.

In the final years before my transition,
I was begging the pieces to fit perfectly.
I wanted a narrative that could prove my gender,
once and for all.

There isn't one.

---------

A friend asks me what it means to be a woman.
I have no idea.
What does it mean for you to be your gender?

---------

I'm terrified that I just want sleepovers,
and I'm too late for that.

The internet is all tweens and teens,
afraid they are too old for hormones.
I read all the wrong things,
and cry for weeks.

---------

I believed gender was only a performance
when my own gender was a performance.
Others believe gender aligns with genitals,
because theirs does.
It's hard to look beyond your own experience.
That's why we have empathy.

I realized I was trans
when rejecting gender only made things worse.

---------

Your humanity is not a debate.
Your value is not a difference of opinion. ❤

---------

I never felt like a girl. 
What do girls feel like?
I didn't *always know*,
and dream of wearing dresses.
I wasn't consistent, insistent, or persistent.

I was *frustrated*.

Even after I pinned that pain
on my gender,
it took years to make sense of the pieces.

---------

Sometimes you don't know the pain is real
until it goes away.

---------

Transition is a wild waffling
between dysphoria and euphoria.
The changes are minor,
and the effect is unbelievable.
I'm the same person,
and not at all the same person.
I lost two show sizes.

---------

When they gender you right,
in that condecending tone reserved for women.
Stealth is a mixed blessing.

---------

Many people become frustrated by the trappings of gender — 
the rules and regulations imposed by our culture.
Then the boys find their inner princess,
and girls grow up to be president (please),
and everyone moves on.

As my brother says,
*cis does not mean simple*.

I wanted that story too — 
a complex gender,
breaking from tradition
without crossing any lines.
I hoped gender was only a construct,
and a change in performance could destroy my dysphoria.
I wanted to express my feminine traits and move on.

But *feminine* is not my gender.
Painted nails are not what it means to be a woman.
Gender is often performed,
but the performance is not the whole story.
The play is not the thing.

---------

A visiting trans friend asks where I get my T.

*I make it inside my body*,
I tell him.
*I'd give it to you if I could*.

---------

My doctor doesn't require
a therapist's approval,
but she tells me
*it's helpful if you have one*.
I don't know what that means.
My therapist writes a letter,
just in case.

I have to sign a form
that explains the effects of hormone therapy.
They bring me the wrong form:
*Consent for Masculinizing Hormone Therapy*.
I ask for the other form, please.
Probably a clerical error,
but it feels good.

This is called *informed consent*.
Expect breast growth,
changes in body fat,
and thinning body hair.
Don't expect changes in voice
or facial hair.

The form is full of typos,
but I sign it anyway.
Later that day,
I take my first hormone pills.

---------

I'm still learning to identify as a woman,
and as a lesbian.
Both are over-simplifications.
Maybe a non-binary genderqueer trans
bi/pansexual femme tomboy lesbian woman?

I was assigned male,
and learned to identify as a man — 
no matter how odd or painful that felt.
My identity was male for 33 years,
and that's not easy to shake off.

---------

My gender identity is frustrated? |br|
My gender frustration is female?

---------

A friend jokes about the useless buttons
on the back of my new coat.
*Those buttons are't useless*,
I tell him.
*That's how people know I'm a woman*.

---------

I'm not trans because of the things I like,
or the people I sleep with.
I'm not trans in order to paint my nails,
fuck boys, join a coven,
or get a free drink on Ladies Night.
I'm not exploring my feminine side,
or enjoying the realities of sexism,
objectification, double-standards, mansplaining, and harassment.

I could do all those things before transition.
I'm trans because the doctors called me a man
and they were wrong.

---------

I thought I was borrowing a scraper,
but then he just cleaned off the car for me.
This doesn't happen when you look like a boy person.

---------

The bank ask to see my marriage license.
When I don't have one,
they ask *the reason for your name change*?
I make a list of reasons:

- That time of the week.
- Just in case.
- Lost my old one on the bus to Boulder.
- Identity theft.

---------

There's a period where
I can't use *he/him/his* for anyone.

---------

I don't know how many trans people I know.
After transition, many fade from view.
Cis-assumption helps us blend in,
for our own safety.
Other's haven't come out yet.

Visibility is dangerous,
but without it we're monsters under the bed.

---------

When I say *gender change*,
people only hear *genitals*.

---------

We talk about socialization,
as though kids
only ever hear half the story —
as though we don't train everyone
to hate women equally.

Simultaneously,
I recieved privilege as a man,
while internalizing the messages for women.
I wasn't socialized male.
I was socialized binary.

---------

Dysphoria doesn't take the time
to stop and explain itself.
It's a subtle,
grumpy, subconscious beast — 
like an upset stomach,
or the anger you feel when you haven't eaten.

Gender dysphoria is *hangry*.

---------

Cis women warn me about
the emotional terrors of estrogen.
*Clearly you haven't tried testosterone*,
I say.
*That shit'll fuck you up*.

---------

I tell my mom on the phone,
*I think I'm more binary than I think*.
She's confused.
*I think I need to transition.*

I watch a video of Kate Bornstein,
and think *yes, I need to be a woman
before I can be non-binary.*

Natalie agrees.
*Women can be anything.
Transition first, then explore*.

---------

Trying on clothes to see if they fit
is way better than trying on clothes to see if your gender fits.
I didn't know there was a difference,
but there is.

I can finally hate my body for the normal reasons.

---------

*Transgender* and *Transsexual* always existed somewhere else,
in another world.
Extreme terms.
I felt an affinity
for cross-dressers, drag queens, and trans women alike
(I wouldn't distinguish until later), 
but the connection was fragile.
They seemed so fierce and fabulous
(or do I mean thin?) —
nothing like a thick Indiana farm-boy.

On screen, their stories always ended badly.

---------

I love my new emotional clarity.
I can't lift my bass amp, but who cares?
I wish it wasn't so cold
all the time.

---------

I called myself trans for the first time
while speaking to 60-some relatives at a family reunion.
Sometimes I do things the hard way.

Everyone was supportive,
but no one noticed their pronouns,
and it felt like nothing would ever change.

Grandma asked if I was planning to transition medically,
and I said no.
I was wrong.
I've been wrong many times.

----------

Robert spends the night,
but Audrey isn't allowed to.

Later,
the boys tell me not to play with her
on the playground,
and I listen.

----------

A stranger asks me if I'm
*like, full tranny*.
That's not a thing.

---------

Living as a boy,
pink became a symbol of something
I could never fully imagine.
Pink was a personal rebellion,
played off as politics.

But pink is only subversive for men.
In the end,
my rebellion reinforced my misgendering.
A month into transition,
I cleared all the pink from my closet.

---------

Hormones are slow magic.

---------

I watch Eddie Izzard,
and think maybe I'm an *action transvestite*,
but the lazy/fat kind,
who has no time for makeup,
and finds dresses unflattering.

Megan asks if I've been a good boy this year.
*I'm not very good at being a boy,
if that's what you mean.*
She says I'm genderqueer,
so I attend the
Trans and Genderqueer Writers Conference.

Rose asks me, *what pronouns do you use at home*?
That's not the question she meant to ask,
and not the question I wish I was answering.

Erin is the first to ask me point-blank.
I don't know the answer,
so I ask her to use all the pronouns.
She does that perfectly for a week.
I like it best when she's using she or her —
but it's hard getting anyone else to follow suit.

I think maybe changing my name
will help people change my pronoun.
It doesn't.

I tell Natalie how I feel.
She says
*that's because you're not on hormones yet*.
I believe her,
but there's a waiting list.

---------

In my dreams, I'm transgender.
In the mirror, I'm uncertain.
In public, I'm a woman.

Being trans isn't about knowing your gender,
or even seeing it.
I transitioned on faith —
my intuition jumping out ahead of my identity.
I'm still surprised when I look in the mirror,
but I look as often as I can —
for the euphoria of that surprise,
or just to normalize it over time.

---------

— Ma'am, that account says 'Eric Meyer' |br|
— That's my old… boyfriend? Can I change it?

---------

I took a few voice lessons,
for a better sense of control over my presentation.
I don't worry about a particular pitch,
or gender-socialized speech patterns —
just dropping some of that bass chest resonance.
It was something small I could do
before the hormones kicked in.

---------

This was never a male body,
it was always a trans body.

My body was trans as a kid. |br|
My body is trans now. |br|
My body will always be trans.

---------

In Colorado,
your chosen name has to sue your given name
for the right to exist.

---------

I had a nightmare about swimming.
First I was worried about the swimsuit I don't have.
Then I saw the locker room doors,
and woke up in a panic.

---------

After years of looking queer,
it's strange to realize
you're suddenly no-longer noteworthy —
just one more woman walking down the street.
It happened while I wasn't paying attention:
the queer kids stopped giving me that knowing nod.

Whatever made me stand out before,
now only blends me in.

---------

TSA policy is not friendly to trans bodies,
but PreCheck usually gets me where I need to go.

---------

Transition is not a binary.
We all exist on a spectrum,
stretching out in many dimensions.

My transition will never be complete,
and my gender will never be simple or static.
*Woman* is only one label among many.
None are perfect on their own,
but we live in the intersections.
We contain multitudes.

---------

I don't believe in authenticity,
but I do believe in pain,
and doing something to survive it.
