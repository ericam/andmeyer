Twined Fragments, with Allison Washington
=========================================

`Twined Fragments`_
is an ongoing collaboration between myself and
`Allison Washington`_.
Each fragment is sparked by the previous,
as trans women of different generations
pass our memories back and forth,
reflecting on lives and transitions
separated by a quarter-century.

Working through these fragments of reflection
lets us touch on moments and emotions
that are sometimes too painful to interrogate deeply.
In conversation, we do together what we could not alone.

The result leaves us with more questions than answers,
and we love that.
We want those questions,
and hope you will extend the conversation
in the comments below the article.

Chapter 1 (`Mothers, Fathers, Husbands, Wives`_) is available now,
and Chapter 2 is coming soon…

    In the oral history of my family,
    it’s my brother who claims he’ll be a mommy someday,
    nursing his doll.
    Mom corrects him — *you can be a daddy*.
    He lays down the doll.
    Cis doesn’t mean simple,
    he tells me now,
    a father of two.
    I keep my dolls much later in life,
    an unexpected aunt.
