  `Twined Fragments`_
  is an ongoing collaboration between myself and
  `Allison Washington`_.
  Each fragment is sparked by the previous,
  as trans women of different generations
  pass our memories back and forth,
  reflecting on lives and transitions
  separated by a quarter-century.

*****************************************
Twined Fragments, with Allison Washington
*****************************************

Working through these fragments of reflection
lets us touch on moments and emotions
that are sometimes too painful to interrogate deeply.
In conversation, we do together what we could not alone.

The result leaves us with more questions than answers,
and we love that.
We want those questions,
and hope you will extend the conversation
in the comments below the article.

- Chapter 1: `Mothers, Fathers, Husbands, Wives`_
- Chapter 2: `Shifting Nouns`_
- Chapter 3 is coming soon…
