Grandma, I was wrong
====================

Three years ago,
I came out to my extended family
at a reunion in Michigan.
It was the first time I had called myself trans
in front of other people.
I still don’t know what that means.

Grandma asks how often I wear dresses.
*It depends on the weather*.
She seems happy with that.

--What pronouns should we use? |br|
--*She… or they.* |br|
--I don’t like they. Are you going to have surgery? |br|
--*I don’t… think so?* |br|
--Will you still date women? |br|
--*Will they still date me?*

In October of that year,
I changed my name publicly.
In January,
I swallowed my first *hormone replacement* pills --
a mix of Spironolactone
(an androgen-blocker)
and Estradiol
(an estrogen).
This September,
I will stop taking the androgen-blockers,
after undergoing the first surgery of my life:
a procedure officially called vaginoplasty,
but more colloquially referred to as *bottom surgery*.

Grandma, I was wrong.


-------


"The Surgery" Disclaimer
========================

When we come out as trans,
the most common reaction
(after losing friends and family)
is to ask about *the surgery*.

When we ask to change the gender-markers
on government-issued documents,
many states ask for proof of *the surgery*.

When we say *transition*
people only hear *genitals*.

Historical terms like *Sex Reassignment Surgery* (SRS)
or *Gender Reassignment Surgery* (GRS)
also imply a centrality and finality to this one procedure --
as though we aren't *real* men or women
before we've undergone genital reconstruction.

In reality,
there are many aspects to transition --
social, legal, and medical --
with every person choosing their own path.
There is no right way to be trans,
just as there is no right way to be a woman.

Bottom surgery is only one in a long list of interventions
that can help reduce gender dysphoria,
and improve our quality of life.
It may be right and necessary for some of us,
but it does not define our genders or transitions.
It is not the primary intervention,
nor the most common,
nor the final --
but in a society that places the full weight of gender
on our genitals,
this one procedure tends to
grab the communal (often salacious) attention.

There is no "the surgery" for all trans people.
I'm already a complete and real woman --
I only hope to become more comfortable in my own body,
to trade in some of my gender dysphorias
for a chance at something better.

Our stories don't have to be defined only by pain --
we can also strive for *comfort* and *pleasure*
and a *joy* in our own bodies.


-------


Change of Plans
===============

Trans people are often called on to explain ourselves,
and defend our medical interventions
to a cis public that finds us fascinating or disgusting.
We are expected to beg for validity at every step --
a mindset that leads directly
to the current `moral panic around trans children`_.

.. _moral panic around trans children: https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/desistance/564560/

(I don't love linking The Atlantic here,
since they stoke the flames from all sides --
but it's a good article on the topic.)

I don't want to play that game,
but I am happy to share some of my experience
in case it can help other trans people
in similar situations.

I spent years dissociating from my body --
entirely unaware of the pain or identity
driving that distance.
Looking back, it's easy to read all the signs,
but at the time no one in my life
(especially me) knew what to look for.
One of my `favorite comedians`_ expresses this best,
with her roommate metaphor
near the end of this wonderful set:

              {
                'video': '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGn6kZJaznI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>',
                'size': 'full',
              }
            ]

Over the course of my transition,
I've begun to heal that relationship with my body --
but the progress is not linear or clean.
Every step forward reveals a new layer
of repressed trauma in my body,
along with a euphoria of new discovery.

In the spring of 2017
I began to consider bottom surgery more seriously.
I did research on `how it works`_
(CW: this video is graphic,
and uses outdated "MtF" language),
and learned about the development
of genital tissue.
I began to see my body in new ways,
and found that it was much easier to own and understand
my physical form.
I talked to friends,
and learned what to expect.
Finally, I researched `available surgeons`_,
and sent an application to Dr. Marci Bowers --
one of the leading experts in the field.

The next week,
I get a phone call from her office:

--Are you available on June 9, 2020? |br|
--*Uh… Sure?*

I call mom:

--Some people will struggle with this. |br|
--*What are they resisting?* |br|
--It’s like they feel about tattoos, permanent changes to your body. |br|
--*Like having your ovary removed?* |br|
--Maybe it’s harder when it’s on the outside. |br|
--*Great! Tell them I’m moving it to the inside!*

The Wait
========

With limited surgeons and increased interest,
waitlists have been growing quickly.
We've come to expect a 2-5 year wait,
and out-of-network (out-of-pocket) treatment,
far from home.
Many people wait on multiple lists,
and hope to get moved up after a cancelation.
But recently,
there's been a push for more doctors
to become certified.

This is a wonderful development,
but what we gain in access and affordability,
we lose in detailed knowledge about our surgeons
and their credentials.
This used to be a specialty procedure,
performed by the well-known expert of your choice
(if you can afford it).
As it becomes more common
and covered by insurance,
most of us simply have to go where we're told.
Meanwhile, there are no national standards for certification,
and each hospital is making it up as they go.

While I was looking into insurance options,
I discovered that Denver Health
was working with Dr Bowers to train local surgeons,
and a Denver Health plan would be guaranteed to cover
this new Denver Health surgery.
I switched my insurance at the end of the year,
applied for the new DH waiting list,
and immediately began preparation.
With an unknown timeline,
I wanted to be ready.

In the meantime I've done my research on Dr Chris Carey,
my new surgeon.
Previous patients of Dr Carey have recommended him,
and he seems to have the training to to back up his new credentials.

I get a call in early July:

-- Can you be ready in August? |br|
-- *No, I'll be traveling.* |br|
-- Have you completed hair removal? |br|
-- *Mostly.* |br|
-- Get it done.

They call again this week:

-- When do you get home? |br|
-- *September 9.* |br|
-- Can we schedule you on September 10?

"How Can I Help?"
=================

As I've started to share the news,
many people have asked how they can help.

I'll be in the hospital for 3-4 days.
After that,
recovery is slow and difficult --
with 4-6 weeks of limited movement
before I'm back to my routine,
and back to work.
The bills and the boredom are likely to pile up,
and you can help with both:


1. Social
---------

I have three amazing women
who will be my primary caretakers
during recovery --
Erin, Rachel, and my mom --
but it would be great to have visitors,
or help with meals along the way.
This is hard to plan in advance,
since we're not entirely sure
when I'll have time or energy.
If you want to drop by the hospital
(Sept 10-13),
or my house (the rest of Sept, into Oct),
get in touch with one of them.

If you need contact information,
let us know.


2. Financial
------------

With my insurance,
I expect to pay roughly $1300 in preparation
(surgery-site hair removal),
and another $7150 for the surgery
(my out-of-pocket maximum).
I will also lose 6 weeks wages,
while trying to cover all my normal bills.
All told, I'm looking at $10k-12k
in surgery-related expenses.

That's a debt I'm willing to take on,
but it's not money that I have.
If you want to help financially,
either through `purchasing art`_,
or with a `direct gift`_,
any amount will help make a difference.

3. Support Others
-----------------

Thank you for all the support
that you've shown me through my transition.
I feel very lucky to have friends and family
that have stood by me,
and asked how to be helpful.

Many of my friends are less fortunate.
Here are a few places you can volunteer or donate
to help trans people more broadly:

- `Gender Identity Center of Colorado <https://www.facebook.com/donate/285481692031069/288652908380614/>`_
- `The Trevor Project <https://www.thetrevorproject.org/>`_
- `Transgender Law Center <https://transgenderlawcenter.org/>`_

-------

Thank you again for all your love and support
over the last few years --
it means the world to me.

*Much love,* |br|
❤️ Mia
