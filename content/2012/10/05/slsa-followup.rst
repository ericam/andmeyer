A Whirlwind of Digital Humanities
=================================

After submitting on a whim,
I was `invited to perform`_
last weekend at the SLSA_
conference in Milwaukee,
and I went.
This was not a reasonable thing to do.

Friday
------

It was a whirlwind_ of a weekend.
The piece,
|obsolete|,
requires a long list of props,
but all I took along was a shopping list:

  - overhead projector
  - party hats
  - noise makers
  - an old book about dance
  - 10-page printed handouts
  - tweed jacket
  - whiskey

I flew in on Friday night,
drank a bottle of sake,
and commandeered my friend, Micah,
as a driver for the next day.

Saturday
--------

Overhead projectors are not easy to find,
but Micah tracked one down
at a party-supply rental shop on the other side of town.
When we arrived, they had to dust it off and test the bulb.
Lucky for us, it worked.

And our luck lasted the entire day.
Apart from a few problems with printers and staplers,
we found everything with time to spare.

      (1) Two trips to FedEx & two shitty staplers, but we have handouts.
      (2) Party supplies & a cute boy behind the counter at Walgreen's.
      (3) Goodwill has tweed & an old book for me,
          and three gilded soccer trophies for Micah.
      (4) A bread knife helps make this old western more anonymous.
      (5) Just enough to whiskey for a 10-minute piece.
      (6) "Mad GAY" graffiti conversation above the urinal (unrelated).

We had to sneak into the conference,
because neither of us had registered,
carried our gear upstairs to
Frontier Airlines Center 201C,
I performed for ten minutes,
and flew out again the next day.

The other performances included
Jeremy Douglass,
Katherine Hayles,
Patrick Jagoda,
Patrick LeMieux,
Clarissa Lee,
Amy Letter,
M.D. Coverley,
Mark Marino,
Nick Montfort,
and Stuart Moulthrop.
A great group!

Sunday
------

Frontier Airlines flight 577.

There is `video`_ of the performance,
thanks to the wonderful `Mark Marino`_.
You can't see things very well,
but you can `follow along on the website`_
and put all the pieces together.
It will be just like you were there
with handout in hand!
