*****************

The multimedia arts (`non`_)magazine,
`The Operating System`_ has asked to cross post
my `creative process mini-series`_.
I'm honored. Thank you, The Operating System.
We started with a brief
`introduction to my work`_.

They accept comments over there as well,
so we'll make things as interactive as possible.
Feel free to read along,
or join in the conversation at any point.
I'm happy to answer questions,
go on tangents,
dispute semantic minutia,
and otherwise be influenced by your thoughts.

Let's do this!
