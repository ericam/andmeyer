  An interview on art and media…


Collaboration, Queer Art, and a Multi-Media Novel
=================================================

The `Boulder Writers' Workshop`_
ran this `interview with me`_
at the end of August.

Here's a bit
regarding my `upcoming class`_:

  **BWW:** Your upcoming workshop titled,
  “F*ck the Muse: Grab Your Writing by the Nasty Bits,”
  sounds like instruction in hand-to-hand combat techniques.
  Are you going to show writers how to attack the muse,
  rather than surrender to where she may, or may not, take them?

  **EM:** It’s hand-to-hand-combat,
  but it’s also foreplay,
  late night conversations,
  passionate love-making,
  silent hand-holding,
  and occasional slapstick misunderstandings.
  What’s important is that you participate as an equal.

Don't let the muse stick you in a rut.
Take control of your art.

Fuck the Muse
