  Successful collaboration is knowing when to bring people together
  and when to send them home with individual assignments."

Collaboration, Queer Art, and a Multi-Media Novel
*************************************************

The Boulder Writers' Workshop
ran `this interview with me`_
at the end of August.

  Collaboration doesn't have to be a social activity.
  Successful collaboration is knowing when to bring people together
  and when to send them home with individual assignments.
  Parallel-play is more useful than consensus.
  The group is just there for cross-pollination.
  And then you edit.
