  You make life wonderful —

Saying “Thank You”
==================

I was reminded yesterday,
while being harassed outside the
`Planned Parenthood`_
where a friend of mine works,
`why I do what I do`_.
Not for a distant invisible truth,
but for the world around me and the people in it.
You make life wonderful —
laughing, drinking, sexting, dancing, vomiting, holding hands —
the whole bloody works.

You were always the wind beneath my *proverbials*,
but with the `GreenMud RocketHub campaign`_
you signed me on to a contract.
Crowdfunding isn't a charity system,
and I made promises in return for your support.
One of the rewards
was a custom illustrated portrait,
and this week I finished the first one:

One down, twelve to go.
At the same time,
I'm working on the final
neutral narrator font
for the frontmatter
and short interlude chapters.
