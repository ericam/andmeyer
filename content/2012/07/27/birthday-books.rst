Birthday Books
==============

My birthday was on Tuesday,
and I received several fantastic books
from fantastic friends.

Julie gave me
"Lighthead_"
by `Terrance Hayes`_.
`Toi Derricotte`_ had introduced us
to this book during the
`Naropa Summer Writing Program`_,
and I can't wait to dive in.

  It was the night I embraced Ron's wife a bit too long /
  because he'd refused to kiss me goodbye /
  that I realized the essential nature of sound.

I also received
"The Use of Pleasure"
by Michel Foucault,
"Perdido Street Station"
by China Mi√©ville,
and my second copy of
"Steel Like an Artist"
by `Austin Kleon`_.
Now I have an extra copy to loan out!
