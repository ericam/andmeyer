Birthday Books
==============

My birthday was on Tuesday,
and I received several fantastic books
from fantastic friends.

Julie gave me
"Lighthead_"
by `Terrance Hayes`_.
`Toi Derricotte`_ had introduced us
to this book during the
`Naropa Summer Writing Program`_,
and I can't wait to dive in.

      "It was the night I embraced Ron's wife a bit too long /
      because he'd refused to kiss me goodbye /
      that I realized the essential nature of sound."

I also received
