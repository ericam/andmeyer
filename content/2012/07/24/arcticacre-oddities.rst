Oddities and Curious Lands
==========================

In case you are ever bored,
there are some things you should be doing
on the internet.
Several of those things were made by

You might start with the games_
("i made this, you play this, we are enemies"
shown above),
then perhaps some
"`Stunningly Harmful Songs`_...for
spreading and baffling and loving."
You can explore on your own from there.

      The <a href="http://www.arcticacre.com/">arctic(acre) is not</a>
      to say cold,
      so much as barren,
      unable to procreate in the usual sense,
      and so making what the he in question calls games
      or poetry or chaos
      or any other
      <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ramblemancy">ramblemancy</a>
      of words like butter.
      Birthed by the maternal
      womb-like structures of Adobe Flash,
      and his fear of obsolesence.
