Oddities and Curious Lands
==========================

In case you are ever bored,
there are some things you should be doing
on the internet.
Several of those things were made by
`Jason Nelson`_.

You might start with the games_
("i made this, you play this, we are enemies"
shown above),
then perhaps some
"`Stunningly Harmful Songs`_...
for spreading and baffling and loving."
You can explore on your own from there.
