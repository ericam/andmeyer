Moving off Tumblr
=================

I've enjoyed using tumblr for the most part,
but it's difficult to maintain a custom design
and get all the details just the way I like them.

Instead, I'm moving to the rstblog_
static site generator.
While I'm at it,
I've simplified the design
down to a bare minimum.

It may take some time to get all my old posts
ported over to the new system.
Stay with me.
In the meantime,
I will try to become more regular
in my posting habits,
and more diverse in my posting topics.
