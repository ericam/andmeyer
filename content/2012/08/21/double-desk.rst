  I always build my own desksâ€¦


Double-decker standing desk
===========================

The internet says I'm `getting fat`_,
and `slowly decomposing`_ as I work,
so I decided to do something about it:

I always build my own desks.
You can make a desk in minutes
from any number of common components,
and tear it down just as fast if you need more space.

You can get a door for $3 at Habitat for Humanity,
or any similar used household supply store.
The hollow ones work great, and they're easy to move around.
You can use any number of office objects for support,
from filing cabinets (doubly useful)
to tv-tables, crates, bookshelves, and so on.

Place the door with the doorknob away from you,
and use that hole to organize your cables.

      Or leave the doorknob in, and lock your desk before leaving the office.

If you need extra desk space,
add a third support and a second door.
I regularly add and remove doors per project,
as I need more desk or floor space.

This time, instead of spreading out, I decided to build up.
The result is a more compact work space,
more organized cables,
and an extra shelf I can start using.

I hear it will also save my life,
but we'll have to see how that works out.
