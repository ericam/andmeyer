  Focus on the experience.


Poetry Doesn't Matter (but you should)
======================================

Theatres are concerned about the lack of audience.
Poets are concerned about their lack of audience.
Classical musicians are concerned.
Dance companies are concerned.
Every one is filled with concern for the "survival"
of their medium.

Yesterday I ran across "`Can Poetry Matter?`_",
an old-but-somewhat-prescient article
about the dwindling influence of modern poetry,
circulating again through the community.

.. _Can Poetry Matter?: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1991/05/can-poetry-matter/5062/

It's a good article,
but it's the wrong question.


The Medium is Irrelevant
------------------------

  The established rituals of the poetry world —
  the readings, small magazines, workshops, and conferences —
  exhibit a surprising number of self-imposed limitations.
  Why, for example, does poetry mix so seldom with music, dance, or theater?

I don't care about poetry.
A medium is merely a description -
a reduction used for analysis and critique.

Amanda Palmer isn't successful because
"punk-influenced German-expressionist-cabaret keyboard" is a hit genre.
She's not riding a wave, she *is* the wave.
There was no market for mp3 players,
but iPods changed the music industry.
Lady Gaga is peddling experimental performance art,
but you'll never hear her say it.

Only poets buy "poetry" -
everyone else is buying the experience it provides.
Don't argue that poetry should matter.
Prove that *you* matter.


Finding an Audience is Your Job
-------------------------------

  Like subsidized farming that grows food no one wants,
  a poetry industry has been created
  to serve the interests of the producers and not the consumers...
  Poets must recapture the attention of the broader intellectual community
  by writing for nonspecialist publications.
  They must also avoid the jargon of contemporary academic criticism
  and write in a public idiom.

My audience will not search me out.
They are not waiting patiently for my next move.
If they look at my work and don't see a way in,
they will turn around and leave.

The concern for "poetry"
is a nostalgic yearning for a ready-made audience.
Let it die.
We can do better with the audience that we build for ourselves.

This isn't a problem,
this is an opportunity.
