Lori DeBoer on Self Doubt
=========================

`Lori DeBoer`_ is a very smart person.

  What has changed in my years of writing
  is that I’ve come to regard the state of self-doubt as normal.
  The trick to dispel doubts? Write anyway.

Or, as `Megan Sumner`_ said last night
after asking `The Bloggess`_ a similar question:

  Pretend you're really good at it.

More from Lori:

  When you train your brain to write
  by making room in your day for doing so regularly,
  you dispel doubt’s strength.
  You become attuned to the process as much as the outcome.
  Cultivating creativity as a habit
  turns writing into a ritual that is comforting.
  You begin to write for yourself,
  not as a way to meet other people’s expectations,
  and you become more confident in your own set of experiences
  and ability to turn out a piece worth reading.
