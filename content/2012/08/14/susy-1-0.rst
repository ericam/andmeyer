The interface and syntax have been simplified
so that the language is consistent and easy to understand.
We cleaned up the output,
taking into account Compass browser-support settings,
and giving you more control over exactly how your grids are built.
Then we added a load of responsive tools
and optional new settings
to make Susy as absolutely flexible as possible.

Happy coding!
