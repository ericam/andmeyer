  to isolate components and
  automate style documentation
  with a **design system built for your needs**.

  **CSS has come a long way since the browser wars** of the late 90s.
  What used to be a struggle,
  is now often a breeze (see ``box-shadow`` or ``border-radius``).

  with DOM-aware variables
  and calculations that can drive your design,
  without all the invasive Javascript.
