The Post-Obsolete Book (again)
==============================

`The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World as Represented by an Obsolete Book About Dance`_
is a reflection on the obsolescence of obsolescence,
and a performable website in the spirit of `Michelle Ellsworth`_.
This summer it also became a gallery installation,
when I was invited to install & perform
in the `Electronic Literature Organization`_ conference gallery.

`Illya Szilak`_ reviewed the show `The Huffington Post`_,
and `Kathi Inman Berens`_ (the gallery curator) posted
the video above on YouTube.

Thanks for keeping the obsolete book alive!
