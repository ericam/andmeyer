  Denver Health now provides vaginoplasty surgery --
  a welcome addition to their other services
  for trans patients.
  Since the service is so new,
  they've had trouble getting information out
  in a timely way.
  This is a summary of my notes
  from their first formal information session,
  and the materials they sent home with us.

Denver Health Vaginoplasty Information
**************************************

Vaginoplasty has historically been expensive,
and hard to access --
but ObamaCare ensures coverage,
making it a more realistic option for trans women…
if only there were surgeons available.

I applied for Dr. Marci Bowers waiting list
in the spring of 2017,
and recieved a phone call a couple weeks later:

-- Is this Miriam Suzanne?
-- Yes
-- This is Dr Bowers Office,
we're calling to ask if you'll free
on June 9, 2020.
-- Uh…

In response to the growing demand,
hospitals are rushing to train surgeons.
That's wonderful.
Suddenly we are seeing more local opportunity
and accessibility --
but that also means less control
(insurance has opinions),
and less information on the doctors involved.

For better and worse,
vaginoplasty is moving from specialty surgery
(often considered elective)
to commonplace, commodity offering.
But there is still no standard for certification,
so every hospital is making it up as they go,
with whatever help they can get from the experts.

That rush is evident at Denver Health,
where two surgeons have been training under Dr. Bowers,
and one (Dr. Carey) began offering the procedure in July --
after an internal review of his credentials
by the ethics board in June.
But the hospital only has a single patient navigator
trying to manage a two year backlog of candidates,
and communication has been spotty until this month.
Now that things are moving forward,
it's a scramble to get everyone informed,
prepared, and scheduled --
without any more delays.
