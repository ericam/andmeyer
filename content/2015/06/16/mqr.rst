Interview: Michigan Quarterly Review
====================================

|sidesaddle|

A great interview with the insightful `Ryo Yamaguchi`_
at `Michigan Quarterly Review`_:

  Riding SideSaddle* is not like most things you’ve read.
  On the surface it startles with its three-dimensionality —
  it’s not a spinebound book but a deck of cards,
  and you shuffle it before each reading.
  It’s a new, and wonderful, adventure each time,
  a story of outcasts, their caretaker,
  and the friendship and love they find with each other.
  It’s a story about the body and hybridity —
  based on the myth of Hermaphroditus —
  and it’s a story about magic and the slipperiness of categories.
