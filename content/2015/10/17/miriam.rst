E Miriam Suzanne
================

It’s the third Saturday in October,
which everyone knows is
“Announce Your New Name/Gender —
If You Were Once Called Eric A Meyer,
But Not The One Who Wrote The CSS Reset,
The Other One, You Know — Day”.
It’s a long title for a little-celebrated holiday,
but it’s important to some of us (me).

To commemorate the moment,
I’ve expanded that previously un-defined “M”
that’s been hanging out in the middle of my name —
now “E. Miriam Suzanne” —
with “Miriam” as the colloquial.

Miriam Suzanne is the name
my parents had picked out for me
33-odd years ago,
and forgot to apply.
It's never too late.
Thanks Mom! Thanks Dad!

If you thought I was out a long time ago,
you're not wrong —
but sometimes a slow process
requires the occasional re-fresh.
If you are surprised and confused,
so am I —
maybe we'll get through this together?
If you are interested in some highlights from
my summer-of-trans* reading list,
I made it available online
(and I'm always open to more suggestions).
Happy queerness!
