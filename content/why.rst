The art will speak for its self,
and I must speak for mine:

Nothing is solid,
nothing is set
and nothing will stay where you put it last.
`The clouds shift`_.
Magnetic north shifts.
`Your friends shift`_.
The sun moves from the three hand to the four,
and squirrels are collecting nuts.
So where does that leave us?

Right here,
together,
and each of us entirely alone.
Each a unique mix
of entirely un-unique_ ingredients.
`Blood and bones`_.
Particles bouncing off particles become `abstract thought`_.
And somewhere in there we make love,
go insane,
vomit on our friends,
write music,
start a business,
jump in front of cars,
drop bombs,
build rockets
and sleep on our sides.

We string together our best recollections
and call them `a matter of time`_.
First this,
`then that`_.
But in the end every story is incomplete,
full of holes and misdirections.
We forgot to consider the `importance`_ of his socks,
and we were wrong about the sweat beading on her neck.

That, to me, is beautiful.
Because life can never be said or solved_.
Here we are,
stumbling through this `wreckage and rubble, finding beauty`_ in the world
and in each other along the way.
We fall `between meanings`_
and `explore outside`_ them.
And art gives us a venue to consider the non-sense that remains;
what manifestos_ can never say.
Because understanding is not a pre-requisite for beauty.

So that is what I like.
Narrative that is full of holes and questions.
Bits borrowed_ from `here and there`_,
fused into a `visceral barrage`_ of associations.
Diverse `people breathing`_
and sweating_
and fighting
and playing_
in the rubble_ together.
Accidents_,
contradictions and `broken expectations`_.
Grasping at stability and form_ and meaning,
but always coming up short.

So that we might `stumble towards meaning together`_.
Towards joy and beauty,
in all our queer glory.
