Some Kind of Manifesto
======================

Statements bore me.
A manifesto is |too many words|.
I’m not interested in objects
or intentions —
only the experiences they manifest for real people.
The medium doesn’t matter,
only the people matter.

People are not a standard deviation
from the demographic average.
People are queer.
People are edge cases.
We fall between meanings
and explore outside them.
The average is no one.

That, to me, is **beautiful**.
A life that can never be said or solved.
All of us stumbling
through this wreckage **and rubble together**,
finding beauty in the world
and in each other along the way.
Software that respects our opinions and autonomy;
collaborations that reflect back our diversity;
and art that gives us a venue to consider
the non-sense that remains —
what manifestos can never say.
Because understanding is not a pre-requisite for beauty.

So I like narratives that are full of
holes and misdirection.
Bits borrowed from here and there,
fragments and remixes,
fused into a visceral barrage,
inviting you into an experience —
the start of a conversation.
Diverse people breathing and sweating
and fighting and playing in the rubble together.
Accidents, contradictions, **and broken** expectations.
**Grasping** at stability and form and meaning,
but always coming up short.
