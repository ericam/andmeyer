About Miriam…
*************

People are ``queer``.
People are edge cases.
We fall between meanings,
and explore outside them.
I’m not interested in making objects —
only the experiences they manifest for real people.

That, to me, is beautiful.
All of us stumbling
through this wreckage ``and rubble together``,
finding beauty in the world
and in each other along the way.
Software that respects our opinions and autonomy;
collaborations that reflect back our diversity;
and art that gives us a venue to consider
|the non-sense| that remains —
what manifestos can never say.
Because understanding is not a pre-requisite ``for beauty``.

So I like narratives that are full of
holes and misdirection.
Bits borrowed from here and there,
fragments and remixes,
fused into a visceral barrage,
inviting you into an experience —
the start of ``a conversation``.
Diverse people breathing and sweating
and fighting and playing together.
Accidents, contradictions, and broken expectations.
Grasping at stability and form,
but always ``coming up short``.
