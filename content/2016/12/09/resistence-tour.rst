Some Kind of Resistance Tour, 2017
==================================

It's been a month and change
since our country pseudo-elected
a bigoted blow-hard for president.
I'm heading to DC to protest his inauguration,
visit friends,
and perform some mixed-media resistance:

- reading from my queer-as-fuck novel `Riding SideSaddle*`_,
  while being a loud and vocal trans woman.
- speaking about code, UX, and empathy in tech
  especially given the current state of things.
- chatting about queer identities,
  hate, politics, intersectionality, and resistance.
- hugging people liberally.

I'm not changing the world here,
there's more to do.

Any profits will go to
`one of these rad organizations`_
committed to empowering
women, people of color, immigrants, queers, Muslims, and disabled people —
or fighting climate change.
If you have a specific organization to recommend,
`I'm all ears`_.
