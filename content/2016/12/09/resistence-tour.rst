Resistence Tour, 2017
=====================

It's been a month
since our country pseudo-elected
a bigoted blow-hard for president.
I'm heading to DC to protest his inauguration in January,
visit friends,
and go on a mixed-media resistence tour:

- reading from my queer-as-fuck novel `Riding SideSaddle*`_
- speaking about code, UX, and empathy in tech
- chatting about transition and queer identities
- maybe performing the `post-obsolete book`_?

If I'm able to cover my costs,
any profits will go to
`one of these rad organizations`_
commited to empowering
women, people of color, immigrants, queers, Muslims, and disabled people —
or fighting climate change.
If you have a specific organization to recommend,
`I'm all ears`_.


The schedule so far...
----------------------

- *Jan 15* in **Washington, DC** |br|
  reading at `in your ear`_
  (3pm @ DC Arts Center)
- *Jan 19* in **Fredrick, MD** |br|
  house reading and conversation
  (details TBA)
- *Jan 20-21* in **Washington, DC** |br|

I'll come to you!
-----------------

I'm still looking for readings, meetups,
or other arts/tech/queer events in the area —
from Virginia up to New York City.
If you have an event or contacts in
Baltimore, Philly, NYC,
or anywhere in-between,
please `let me know`_!
