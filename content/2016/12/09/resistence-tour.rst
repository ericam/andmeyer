Some Kind of Resistance Tour, 2017
==================================

It's been a month and change
since our country pseudo-elected
a bigoted blow-hard for president.
I'm heading to DC to protest his inauguration,
visit friends,
and perform some mixed-media resistance:

- reading from my queer-as-fuck novel `Riding SideSaddle*`_,
  while being a loud and vocal trans woman.
- speaking about empathy
  in art and code and software.
- chatting about queer identities,
  hate, politics, and intersectionality.
- hugging people.

I'm not changing the world here,
`there's more to do`_,
but it feels like a nice way to get started,
find my energy,
and find my people.

I'll come to you!
-----------------

I'm still looking for people and places
to read, meetup, and chat —
from Virginia up to New York City.
I have a few events lined up,
but I'm also happy to sit in a living room,
and enjoy the company of anyone there.
Let me know if you're interested in getting together!
