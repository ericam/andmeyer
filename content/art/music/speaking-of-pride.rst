  Minimalist music with fragments of memoir


Speaking of Pride
=================

An LGBT concert of writers and composers
by the `Playground Ensemble`_.
Hear three works by LGBT authors and the composers
who have set their works to music:

**Miss Furr and Miss Skeene** is Gertrude Stein’s
whimsical portrait of a lesbian couple
she knew in Paris in the early 20th century.
Linda Dusman’s percussion music
comments playfully and subtly
on the hypnotic, repetitive text.

**Howl** is Allen Ginsberg’s epic masterpiece,
a poem that defined the Beat Generation.
Written in 1955, its frank depiction of sexuality and drug use
shocked the world.
Lee Hyla’s violent and angular string quartet music
amplifies the intensity of the poem.

**Fragments** is a new work by local author Miriam Suzanne.
Like journal entries, its short, epigrammatic statements
are deeply personal explorations of gender and identity:
poignant, humorous, challenging, startling.
Nathan Hall’s score for string quartet,
percussion, and electric bass
grooves with elements of pop and minimalist music.
