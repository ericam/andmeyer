      Teacup Gorilla's amiable creative approach,
      unorthodox roots and sense of community
      have resulted in a sound that is difficult to pin down:
      part instrumental rock, part glam, part psychedelic, part jazz-inflected.
      And it sounds like nothing much else in this highly imitative era.

  **Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
  with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry —
  often compared to early Modest Mouse,
  Low, or the Velvet Underground.
