  This ain’t grace, this all fucked, this old thing…
summary: |
  Combining the sacrifice, transcendence, blood,
  and circumstance of the Catholic Mass with history,
  live music, science, dance, literature,
  and pop culture to find a wholly modern communion experience.
  What we have left is our selves,
  broken and battered,
  but surviving together.
