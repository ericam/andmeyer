  Grapefruit Lab adapts Kafka
  for a series of DCPA "Bite Size" productions
summary: |
  A family struggles to find humanity and normalcy
  in a world made uncertain and strange
  after the transformation and “othering” of one of their own.
  This physical theatre piece imagines what happens
  on the other side of the iconic door
  in Kafka’s Metamorphosis.
